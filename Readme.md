# PIC16F877A Library

A custom  library for the PIC16F877A microcontroller.

This repository is part of a personal effort to gain a deeper understanding of microcontrollers, low‑level hardware interaction, and embedded C programming. The goal of this project is clarity and learning rather than abstraction.

## About the Project

This repository contains a custom library developed while studying the PIC16F877A microcontroller. All modules are written from scratch to better understand hardware behavior and driver design.

Objectives:

* Understand peripheral registers and hardware operation
* Improve embedded C programming skills
* Reduce dependency on pre‑built frameworks
* Learn practical driver implementation techniques

The project will expand as new microcontroller(uC) concepts are learned and implemented.

## Current Status

Completed:

* [GPIO header implementation] ("https://github.com/ramlaksh2501/library-for-pic16f877a/tree/main/GPIOS")

Planned modules:

* Timers
* Interrupts
* ADC
* UART
* and more

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. You may:

* Use the library in your projects
* Suggest improvements
* Fix issues
* Add features

Please submit a pull request with clear descriptions of the changes.

## Purpose

This is a study‑oriented library and not intended to be a production‑optimized driver. The emphasis is on readability, understanding, and learning embedded system fundamentals.
