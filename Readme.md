# PIC16F877A Library

A custom  library for the PIC16F877A microcontroller.

This repository is part of a personal effort to gain a deeper **understanding of microcontrollers & embedded systems**.

## About the Project

I am building an  entire  library from scratch.

Objectives:
* Learn Register level programming (Bare-metal)
* Understanding **HOW** peripherals, registers and hardware works
* Improve C programming skills and code optimization skills
* Learn practical driver implementation techniques



---

## Current Status

Completed:

* [GPIO header implementation](GPIOS)
    * [Sevensegment LEDs](Seven-segment)
    * [4x4 keypad](Keypad)

Planned modules:

* Timers
* Interrupts
* ADC
* UART
* and more

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. You may:

* Use the library in your projects
* Suggest improvements
* Fix issues
* Add features

Please submit a pull request with clear descriptions of the changes.

## Purpose

This is a study‑oriented library and not intended to be a production‑optimized driver. The emphasis is on readability, understanding, and learning embedded system fundamentals.
